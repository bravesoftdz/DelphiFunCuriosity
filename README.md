# DelphiFunCuriosity
This is a Delphi Firemonkey REST application using Nasa REST API (Rover Curiosity). This application was made to participate in Embarcadero competition : https://community.embarcadero.com/competitions/14-fun-with-delphi-nasa-api-mash-up

This a sample application to use the Nasa REST API and some effects of Firemonkey. This application make it possible 
to visualize images from the rover Curiosity on Mars. You can choose the date and the camera to request the Nasa server 
and visualize the available photos.

You can apply somes effects (like sepia or negative) and zoom in and out on the image.

There is also a 3D sphere with the Mars texture to show where is Curiosity on the planet. You can click on the sphere to
enlarge/reduce the planet.

Just for fun and inspired by : https://github.com/EmbarcaderoPublic/FunWithRADStudio/

Have fun !!!
